Here are a few tips that have worked for me to achieve the desired kind of big picture awareness and mental state suitable both for flow and for strategic thinking:

- keep a simple per-project todo list (I use a text file that I edit with emacs in text mode, one item per line. Delete when finished).

- realize that if you are procrastinating it might be because part of your brain disagrees with a decision you have made. Reflect on the decisions and uncertainties you feel, and let any objection come to the surface of your consciousness. Often the remedy is pretty quick and the procrastination disappears.

- escape the echo chamber. Maybe some people in your life are reinforcing stupid decisions or criticizing good ones. Be brutally honest with yourself and believe in yourself. Seeking social validation is in many ways a crutch.

- environment matters (people, architecture, city, flat, office, etc.). Be picky and find one that gives you the right mix of ingredients for productivity, inspiration, and happiness and doesn't make you feel bad about yourself, discouraged, etc. It may be very different than what works for other people or what is trendy.
